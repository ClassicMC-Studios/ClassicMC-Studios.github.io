            A free bird leaps<br/>
            on the back of the wind   <br/>
            and floats downstream   <br/>
            till the current ends<br/>
            and dips his wing<br/>
            in the orange sun rays<br/>
            and dares to claim the sky.<br/><br/>

            But a bird that stalks<br/>
            down his narrow cage<br/>
            can seldom see through<br/>
            his bars of rage<br/>
            his wings are clipped and   <br/>
            his feet are tied<br/>
            so he opens his throat to sing.<br/><br/>

            The caged bird sings   <br/>
            with a fearful trill   <br/>
            of things unknown   <br/>
            but longed for still   <br/>
            and his tune is heard   <br/>
            on the distant hill   <br/>
            for the caged bird   <br/>
            sings of freedom.<br/><br/>

            The free bird thinks of another breeze<br/>
            and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees<br/>
            and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn<br/>
            and he names the sky his own.<br/><br/>

            But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   <br/>
            his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   <br/>
            his wings are clipped and his feet are tied  <br/> 
            so he opens his throat to sing.<br/><br/>

            The caged bird sings   <br/>
            with a fearful trill   <br/>
            of things unknown   <br/>
            but longed for still   <br/>
            and his tune is heard  <br/> 
            on the distant hill <br/>  
            for the caged bird <br/>  
            sings of freedom.<br/>

            I chose the poem "Caged Bird" because of many things.<br/>
            First off the poem has a very good tone and mood which<br/>
            set a felling perfectly matching what th poem is trying to say.<br/>
            The poem also shows a good theme.<br/>
            The mood this poem sets for me is desolate.<br/>
            I belive that I felt that way because of the trapped nature of the caged brid.<br/>
            The tone of &#8221;Caged bird&#8221; is desparing.<br/>
            &#8221;Caged bird&#8221; is desparing because of its portrayal of the caged bird wishing to be like the free bird.<br/>
            For figurative language I found that the free bird in the poem symbolizes freedom and the ability to go anywhere you want.<br/>
