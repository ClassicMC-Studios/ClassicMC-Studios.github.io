            <b>What I learned in this unit</b><br/>     
            In this unit about poetry I learned a lot of things.<br/>
            As a reader of poetry I have learned easier ways to detect mood and tone.<br/>
            Also I've learned how rhyme scheme effects the way poetry sounds and feels.<br/>
            One of my biggest strengths in reading poems is understanding the meaning.<br/>
            This year I have enjoyed the creation of hikaus as I've become very good at making them.<br/>
            One way I have grown in writing poetry was making consistent rhyme schemes.<br/>
            The most challenging form of poem that I created was a sonnet.<br/>
