            There are very few things like the tree by me  <br/>
            When the wind blew, the leaves would start to sing  <br/>
            When winter rolled around, cracked was my tree <br/>
            When winter became spring,the things you would bring <br/> 
            But all the while there you sat, right there  <br/>
            And when the seasons changed and you grew old  <br/>
            And all the great days we spent just right there <br/>
            All the things we might have done left untold <br/>
            And there I would sit right where you just were <br/>
            For all the age old, forever untold times <br/>
            Me sitting alone with my tree, right there <br/>
            But even the best days must have bedtimes <br/>
            Alone as I sat just me and my tree <br/>
            The one thing I&#39;ll miss the most is my tree <br/> <br/>
            <b>What this poem means</b><br/>
            In the poem you hear about a person moving and leaving something behind<br/>
            This poem is about when you leave something behind.<br/>
            This poem also portrays the feeling of nostalgia<br/><br/>

            <b>The Mountain </b><em>by,ClassicMC</em><br/>
            Atop the mountains <br/>
            I watched the cities below<br/>
            The wind in my face<br/><br/>
            <b>What This poem means</b><br/>
            In &#8221;The Mountain&#8221; you are someone watching a city on a mountain.<br/>
            The poem is about the feeling of freedom.<br/>
            In this poem the person on the mountain is also implied to have no care in the world<br/><br/>

            <b>The lost Bunker</b> <em>by, ClassicMC</em><br/>
                As I walked up a mountain<br/>
                I had quite a scare<br/>
                For sitting right there <br/>
                Was a door to nowhere <br/>
                But as I drew close I noticed that<br/>
                The door had been left ajar in a mudflat<br/>
                And when I peeked in the things that I saw<br/>
                The unexpected things in there<br/>
                Caused me to run and call and leave<br/>
                But as I learned more I found out that<br/>
                What I saw wasn&#39;t the only one out there<br/>
                As I looked around later I found even more<br/>
                But now this abandoned bunker system<br/>
                Shall no longer be more<br/><br/>
                <b>What this poem means</b><br/>
                &#8221;The Lost bunker&#8221; tells of a person stumbling on a lost bunker.<br/>
                This poem is about the unknown of finding something new<br/>
                This poem also shows that there's always something new to find.<br/><br/>
